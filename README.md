# Azure Data Engineering End-to-End Project  
**Azure Data Factory | Databricks | PySpark | Azure Synapse Analytics**

This repository contains an **end-to-end data engineering project** that I completed as part of my learning journey. The project demonstrates the design and implementation of a robust data pipeline leveraging powerful Azure tools and technologies such as Azure Data Factory, Azure Data Lake, Databricks, Azure Synapse Analytics, and Apache Spark.

## üöÄ **Project Overview**  
In this project, I learned how to:  
- Design and implement robust data pipelines using **Azure Data Factory**.  
- Perform data integration and transformation with **Azure Databricks**.  
- Use **Azure Synapse Analytics** for data warehousing and advanced analytics.  
- Apply best practices for big data solutions and real-time data processing with **Apache Spark**.  

This project was completed by following a step-by-step tutorial to build a comprehensive understanding of Azure Data Engineering workflows.
